# How do I propose a new lint, or extend an existing one?

For small lints, you can follow the [policy for smaller changes](./propose.md): implement the lint, open a PR, and then [nominate](./nominate.md) it for lang-team attention. 

We may request an RFC if the lint will warn by default and is expected to affect a lot of users, or if the lint is controversial, we may request an RFC. If in doubt, you can always raise the idea on Zulip first.
